# The MajorBBS Emulation Project
The MajorBBS Emulation project is home to **MBBSEmu**, an Open Source, Self-Contained, Cross-Platform emulator for Galacticomm's The MajorBBS & Worldgroup 
Bulletin Board Software Add-ons. MBBSEmu allows you to play your favorite original, unmodified MajorBBS or Worldgroup Games in your local console or over 
Telnet without having to install and configure additional software. MBBSEmu allows Sysops running 
[Synchronet](https://www.synchro.net/ "Synchronet BBS Software") or [Mystic](http://www.mysticbbs.com/ "Mystic BBS Software") to give their users access 
to MajorBBS & Worldgroup Games on any platform without having to run a Virtual Machine with 30+ year old software!
